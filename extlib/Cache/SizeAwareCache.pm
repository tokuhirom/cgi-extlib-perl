=head1 NAME

Cache::SizeAwareCache -- extends the Cache interface.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SizeAwareCache interface is implemented by classes that support
all of the Cache::Cache interface in addition to the limit_size and
max_size features of a size aware cache.

The default cache size limiting algorithm works by removing cache
objects in the following order until the desired limit is reached:

  1) objects that have expired
  2) objects that are least recently accessed
  3) objects that that expire next

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cache::SizeAwareCache;
  use vars qw( @ISA );

  @ISA = qw( Cache::SizeAwareCache );

=head1 CONSTANTS

Please see Cache::Cache for standard constants

=over

=item I<$NO_MAX_SIZE>

The cache has no size restrictions

=back

=head1 METHODS

Please see Cache::Cache for the standard methods

=over

=item B<limit_size( $new_size )>

Attempt to resize the cache such that the total disk usage is under
the I<$new_size> parameter.  I<$new_size> represents t size (in bytes)
that the cache should be limited to.  Note that this is only a one
time adjustment.  To maintain the cache size, consider using the
I<max_size> option, although it is considered very expensive, and can
often be better achieved by peridocally calling I<limit_size>.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

Please see Cache::Cache for the standard options

=over

=item I<max_size>

Sets the max_size property (size in bytes), which is described in
detail below.  Defaults to I<$NO_MAX_SIZE>.

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

Please see Cache::Cache for standard properties

=over

=item B<(get|set)_max_size>

If this property is set, then the cache will try not to exceed the max
size value (in bytes) specified.  NOTE: This causes the size of the
cache to be checked on every set, and can be considered *very*
expensive in some implementations.  A good alternative approach is
leave max_size as $NO_MAX_SIZE and to periodically limit the size of
the cache by calling the limit_size( $size ) method.
