=head1 NAME

Plack::Component - Base class for PSGI endpoints

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Plack::App::Foo;
  use parent qw( Plack::Component );

  sub call {
      my($self, $env) = @_;
      # Do something with $env

      my $res = ...; # create a response ...

      # return the response
      return $res;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Component is the base class shared between Plack::Middleware
and Plack::App::* modules. If you are writing middleware, you should
inherit from L<Plack::Middleware>, but if you are writing a
Plack::App::* you should inherit from this directly.

=head1 REQUIRED METHOD

=over 4

=item call ($env)

You are expected to implement a C<call> method in your component. This is
where all the work gets done. It receives the PSGI C<$env> hash-ref as an
argument and is expected to return a proper PSGI response value.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new (%opts | \%opts)

The constructor accepts either a hash or a hash-ref and uses that to
create the instance with. It will call no other methods and simply return
the instance that is created.

=item prepare_app

This method is called by C<to_app> and is meant as a hook to be used to
prepare your component before it is packaged as a PSGI C<$app>.

=item to_app

This is the method used in several parts of the Plack infrastructure to
convert your component into a PSGI C<$app>. You should not ever need to
override this method, it is recommended to use C<prepare_app> and C<call>
instead.

=back

=head1 BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

The L<Plack::Middleware> module used to inherit from L<Class::Accessor::Fast>,
which has been removed in favor of the L<Plack::Util::Accessor> module. When
developing new components it is recommended to use L<Plack::Util::Accessor>
like so:

  use Plack::Util::Accessor qw( foo bar baz );

However, in order to keep backwards compatibility this module provides a
C<mk_accessors> method similar to L<Class::Accessor::Fast>. New code should
not use this and use L<Plack::Util::Accessor> instead.
