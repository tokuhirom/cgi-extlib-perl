Plack::Test - Test PSGI applications with various backends

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Plack::Test;

  # named params
  test_psgi
      app => sub {
          my $env = shift;
          return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], [ "Hello World" ] ],
      },
      client => sub {
          my $cb = shift;
          my $req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => "http://localhost/hello");
          my $res = $cb->($req);
          like $res->content, qr/Hello World/;
      };

   use HTTP::Request::Common;

   # positional params (app, client)
   my $app = sub { return [ 200, [], [ "Hello "] ] };
   test_psgi $app, sub {
       my $cb = shift;
       my $res = $cb->(GET "/");
       is $res->content, "Hello";
   };


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Test is a unified interface to test PSGI applications using
standard HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response objects. It also allows you
to run PSGI applications in various ways, by default using C<MockHTTP>
backend but can also use C<Server> backend, which uses one of
L<Plack::Handler> implementations to run the web server to do live HTTP
requests.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item test_psgi

  test_psgi $app, $client;
  test_psgi app => $app, client => $client;

Runs the client test code C<$client> against a PSGI application
C<$app>. The client callback gets one argument C<$cb>, that is a
callback that accepts an HTTP::Request object and returns an
HTTP::Response object.

For the convenience, HTTP::Request given to the callback is
automatically adjusted to the correct protocol (I<http>) and host
names (I<127.0.0.1> by default), so the following code just works.

  use HTTP::Request::Common;
  test_psgi $app, sub {
      my $cb = shift;
      my $res = $cb->(GET "/hello");
  };

Note that however, it is not a good idea to pass an arbitrary
(i.e. user-input) string to the C<GET> function or even C<<
HTTP::Request->new >> by assuming that it always represents a path,
because:

  my $req = GET "//foo/bar";

would represent a request for a URL that has no scheme, has a hostname
I<foo> and a path I</bar>, instead of a path I<//foo/bar> which you
might actually want.

=head1 OPTIONS

You can specify the L<Plack::Test> backend using the environment
variable C<PLACK_TEST_IMPL> or C<$Plack::Test::Impl> package variable.

The available values for the backend are:

=over 4

=item MockHTTP

(Default) Creates a PSGI env hash out of HTTP::Request object, runs
the PSGI application in-process and returns HTTP::Response.

=item Server

Runs one of Plack::Handler backends (C<Standalone> by default) and
sends live HTTP requests to test.

=item ExternalServer

Runs tests against an external server specified in the
C<PLACK_TEST_EXTERNALSERVER_URI> environment variable instead of spawning the
application in a server locally.

=back

For instance, you can test your application with C<ServerSimple> server backends with:

  > env PLACK_TEST_IMPL=Server PLACK_SERVER=ServerSimple prove -l t/test.t
